# The Fetch Network

## Introduction

The **Fetch Network** represents the foundation of the Fetch.ai Ecosystem as it enables the decentralized digital economy driven by [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent), [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) and [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav). The Network provides integration with Fetch blockchain technology, thus ensuring secure, transparent, and scalable transactions, and enhanced trust across the overall Fetch Ecosystem.

### Agents, Agentverse, AI Engine and DeltaV

**Agents** are central to the Fetch Ecosystem; these are software entities that can be programmed to operate autonomously and make decisions or perform tasks on behalf of users, businesses, or devices. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence, Agents can execute complex [Functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions) without requiring direct human intervention. The Fetch Network facilitates the interaction of these agents through multiple key components: the **AI Engine**, **Agentverse**, and **DeltaV**. The AI Engine acts as a bridge between human-readable inputs and Agent actions, breaking down user queries into executable tasks and routing them to the most suitable agents registered within the Fetch Network. DeltaV serves as an interface that allows users to communicate directly with registered agents and functions, making the process of executing task and retrieve information straightforward. Once a query is being submitted, the AI Engine ensures that the most appropriate registered agents are called into action to achieve the objectives provided by the end-user.

### The Almanac Contract

The [Almanac Contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac) is an important component within the Fetch Network. It indeed connects together agents, the Agentverse, and the AI Engine by working as decentralized registry and allowing for agents discoverability and coordination. When agents are registered in the Almanac, they become accessible across the entire Fetch Ecosystem, allowing the AI Engine to dynamically locate and engage with them based on users' or agents' requests. This ensures accurate and reliable execution of tasks, as the Almanac supports the AI Engine in identifying and deploying the most appropriate agents for any given function being requested for execution, amongst all registered agents in the Agentverse and Fetch Network. The Almanac facilitates remote communication between agents but also provides a layer of trust and verification, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for all participants is available at all times. By maintaining an organized directory of agents and their functionalities, the Almanac empowers the AI Engine to coordinate complex multi-agent workflows efficiently.

### Fetch Name Service - FNS

The [Fetch Name Service (FNS) ↗️](/guides/agents/advanced/name-service) is another key element providing human-readable names for interacting with Agents and Functions. The FNS simplifies resource identification and makes it easier for developers and users to access decentralized functions without the need to memorize complex addresses, thus enhancing overall user accessibility.

### Fetch Ledger and Indexer

The [Fetch Ledger ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro) is an additional fundamental component of the Fetch Network. It provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent record of all transactions and data exchanges that take place within the Fetch Ecosystem itself. The Ledger uses the FET token to facilitate transactions, agent interactions, and smart contract execution, but also to ensure that the integrity and efficiency of the Network is maintained. To enhance Ledger data accessibility, the Fetch Network employs an [Indexer ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/indexer) which is based on **SubQuery**. The aim of the Indexer is to organize and index the Ledger data and provide a GraphQL API to enable developers to efficiently query and retrieve information for their applications directly from the Fetch Ledger.

### Jenesis

[Jenesis ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/getting-started) simplifies the development and deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Fetch Network and other CosmWasm-enabled platforms. Jenesis offers a streamlined environment for developers, which reduces the complexity of building blockchain-based solutions and accelerates the deployment of decentralized services and applications.

### CosmPy

As a complement to the above elements, we find [CosmPy ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/install), a Python-based library that facilitates interactions with Cosmos SDK-based blockchains, including Fetch Network. CosmPy provides developers with a straightforward way to manage blockchain transactions, write and test smart contracts, and interact with agents, all within the familiar Python environment.

### Conclusions

These components together constitute the backbone structure of the Fetch Network. These tools are essential in enabling a decentralized economy of autonomous Agents and AI-driven Agent Functions. By leveraging the Fetch ledger, Almanac Contract, FNS, Indexer, Jenesis, and CosmPy, the Fetch Ecosystem focuses on creating an environment where agents can autonomously manage tasks, interact with each other, and create value in a secure and scalable way.

The [FET token ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/native-and-erc20-fet-tokens) empowers the Fetch Ecosystem, providing the economic incentive and governance framework necessary for the sustainability and evolution of the Network itself. The token acts both as the medium of exchange and the incentive structure for participants, while supporting the Network's governance and staking mechanisms.
